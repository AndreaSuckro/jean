A/B Testing is a business term that is tied to the concept of hypothesis testing and commonly used in marketing. Though it has been around for a while and many tools have been developed to do automated A/B Testing, the underlying statistics are widely discussed and each A/B Testing software implements different analytic approaches. I will start by describing the general procedure, then different methods will be compared on a simplified model, starting with more classical approaches and comparing these to the bandit algorithms popular in machine learning. In the discussion I will summarize pros and cons for the presented methods and outline a picture for future development.
