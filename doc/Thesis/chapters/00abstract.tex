This thesis is centered around the frequently used method of automated A/B Testing. Though it has been around for a while and many tools have been developed to do A/B Testing, the underlying statistics are widely discussed and no current standard could be identified. I will start by describing the general procedure.  Then different methods will be compared on a slightly simplified model, starting with the more classical approaches and later comparing those to the Bandit Algorithms popular in Machine Learning. The discussion will show pro's and con's for any method and sketch a useful picture for future development.
