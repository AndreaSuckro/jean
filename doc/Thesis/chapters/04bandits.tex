\chapter{Bandit AB-Testing}
The previous chapter chapter dealt with optimization concerning classical AB-Testing. The following will describe a fundamentally different approach in which there is no separation between the exploration and the exploitation phase. Basically this means that we want to already maximize our profit while gaining information about the other buckets.
\section{Model}
Consider the described test setup in the framework of bandit algorithms.
